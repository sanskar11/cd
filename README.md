**This is a modified version of cd made by me.**

**This supports command like cd ... like zsh**

cd ... is converted to cd ../../

cd .... is converted to cd ../../../ and soon.....*

**To install run the following commands in your home directory:**
1. Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/sanskar11/cd/
2. cd cd
3. bash run.sh
4. source ~/.bashrc

Hope you like the change.
